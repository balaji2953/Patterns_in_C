# Patterns_in_C

This repository contains a collection of various pattern programs implemented in the C programming language. Each program in this repository generates a specific pattern using different loops, conditional statements, and other C language constructs.

## Getting Started
To get started with these pattern programs, make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system. If you don't have one, you can install GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), which is a popular and widely used C compiler.

## Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
 git clone https://github.com/balaji2953/Patterns_in_C.git

### Feel free to explore pattern programs in the repository
